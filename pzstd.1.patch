 .SS "Restricted usage of Environment Variables"
 Using environment variables to set parameters has security implications\. Therefore, this avenue is intentionally restricted\. Only \fBZSTD_CLEVEL\fR is supported currently, for setting compression level\. \fBZSTD_CLEVEL\fR can be used to set the level between 1 and 19 (the "normal" range)\. If the value of \fBZSTD_CLEVEL\fR is not a valid integer, it will be ignored with a warning message\. \fBZSTD_CLEVEL\fR just replaces the default compression level (\fB3\fR)\. It can be overridden by corresponding command line arguments\.
